# Simulated-Annealing-GPU
A simple Simulated Annealing Implementation that utilises the GPU for computation.

Recently I have had to do a lot of optimisation, I felt that there aren't many gpu based stochastic optimisation implementations. This project is a simulated annelaing implementation that uses tensorflow for computations. It is quite fast and can handle a lot of parameters. There are some extra hyper-parameters that aren't found on the vanilla implementations of Simulated Annealing but I feel that these enable better control over the algorithm.

#Requirements :
1. tensorflow 2+ (Eager execution is a must)
2. numpy
